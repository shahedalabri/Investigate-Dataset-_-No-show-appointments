# Investigate-Dataset-No-show-appointments

This dataset compiles data from 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil, focusing on the pivotal question of patient attendance. Each entry encompasses various patient attributes.

The 'ScheduledDay' feature denotes the date when the patient scheduled their appointment. Meanwhile, 'Neighborhood' specifies the hospital's location. Additionally, 'Scholarship' indicates enrollment in the Brazilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia.
